## Greedy Problems

### Notes

#### 1. About Greedy Algorithms
        - Greedy is an algorithmic paradigm that builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most 
          obvious and immediate benefit. 
        - Greedy algorithms are used for optimization problems. 
        - An optimization problem can be solved using Greedy if the problem has the following property: 
             --> At every step, we can make a choice that looks best at the moment, and we get the optimal solution to the complete problem. 
         
#### 2. When can we use the Greedy Method
        - If a Greedy Algorithm can solve a problem, then it generally becomes the best method to solve that problem as the Greedy algorithms are 
          in general more efficient than other techniques like Dynamic Programming. 
        - But Greedy algorithms cannot always be applied. For example, the Fractional Knapsack problem can be solved using Greedy, but 0-1 Knapsack 
          cannot be solved using Greedy.
